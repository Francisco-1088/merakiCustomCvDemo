## Introduction

This tutorial guides you through the process of:

1. Capturing an image dataset using a Meraki MV Camera
2. Training a TensorFlow model on Google Colab from said dataset
3. Evaluating the model
4. Exporting the model to TFLite and deploying it on your camera
5. Using a simple app with TKinter to demo your model
