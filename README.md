# Introduction

This tutorial guides you through the process of:

1. Capturing an image dataset using a Meraki MV Camera
2. Training a TensorFlow model on Google Colab from said dataset
3. Evaluating the model
4. Exporting the model to TFLite and deploying it on your camera
5. Using a simple app with TKinter to demo your model

# Prerequisites

1. Cisco Meraki MV 2nd Generation Camera (MV2, MV12, MV32, MV22, MV72)
2. Software version 4.18 on the camera
3. A Google account (to be able to use Colab)
4. A laptop with a working installation of Python 3 and Docker
